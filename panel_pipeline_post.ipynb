    "For a panel pipeline to work, you must create paramterized classes (inherit from the `param.Parameterized` class) and include param objects.  Param is a library that declares types, ranges and documentation for param objects.  In panel, param is used to link a param object with a certain visualization or computation (using the `@param.depends` method); and in a panel pipeline, the param `@param.output` method is used to indicate the parameters to pass from one stage to the next.  The following stage in the pipeline must also have the same parameters declared in order to consume the output from the previous stage.  \n",

    "I hope you found this post on panel pipelines enlightening.  You can build much for elaborate stages or pipelines with more than 2 stages. You can even have branching stages that depend on user input (clicking a button to go to one stage or clicking another button to go to a different stage, for example).  Its quite flexible.  I encourage you to try building a panel pipeline app that can be useful in your work or daily life.  Not only is it fun, but I think you'll find panel makes it easy to put these stages into place!"
